The â‚¿ Certificate is an internationally recognized exam that evaluates your mastery of Bitcoin and its derived topics. This certificate will enable you to prove your skills and knowledge in the Bitcoin industry, giving you access to the best companies and great job positions.

If you pass the exam a digitally signed and timestamped certificate is issued, to be able to prove your skills.

Find out how to ensure the authenticity and integrity of your certificate in two simple steps:
- Verifying the signature of the certificate's text file
- Verifying the open timestamp of the certificate

We'll provide instructions for both graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) methods to accommodate different user preferences and technical backgrounds.

## Download your certificate

Log into your personal PBN dashboard, go to Credentials page by clicking on the lefthand-side menu and click on your exam session and locate the certificate you want to verify.
Download the zip file ef he certificate and extract the contents of your zip file and you will find three different files inside:

- Signed text file (e.g., certificate.txt.sig)
- Open timestamp (OTS) file (e.g., certificate.txt.ots)
- PDF certificate (e.g., certificate.pdf)

## Step 1: Verifying the Signature of the Text File


### GUI Method (using Sparrow Wallet)

3. Run the following command to verify the signature:

```
openssl dgst -verify planb-network-pk.asc -signature certificate.txt.sig certificate.txt
```

## Step 2: Verifying the Open Timestamp

GUI Method (OpenTimestamps)
